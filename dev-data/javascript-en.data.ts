    bio: 'Hello, I\'m Anna - the course coordinator. Ten years ago, I graduated from Rolling Scopes School. Shortly thereafter, I returned to the school, but this time as a mentor and lecturer. However, that still felt insufficient, so I became a course coordinator. Today, I am a Team Lead at EPAM, working as a front-end developer. My heart is devoted to Angular, but I also respect other frameworks/libraries. I look forward to meeting each of you and hope to see you after graduation, perhaps as colleagues on projects!',
