Contributing ([volunteering](volunteering.md)) to open-source projects is a great way to improve your skills and help the community. Here’s a step-by-step guide to getting started:

### 1. Study the Project
- Familiarize yourself with the [repository](https://github.com/rolling-scopes/site): read the [README.md](README.md), [contributing.md](contributing.md), [git-pullrequest-workflow.md](git-pullrequest-workflow.md) and other documentation.
- Understand the project structure: what each file or directory is for.
- Run the project locally to see how it works.

### 2. You don’t have to write code immediately. Start with:
- Fixing typos or improving documentation.
- Translating documentation.
- Testing the project and reporting bugs.
- If you want to write code, begin with simple tasks: small bug fixes, refactoring, or adding tests.

### 3. Work on Issues
- Look for suitable `issues` in the [Issues](https://github.com/rolling-scopes/site/issues) section on GitHub or [dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/rolling-scopes/projects/6/views/1), or create a task and assign it to yourself ([more](git-pullrequest-workflow.md)). For beginners, look for issues labeled with `good first issue`.
- Make sure the issue is available (not already taken by someone else).
- Comment on the issue asking if you can take it, and wait for confirmation from the maintainer.

### 4. Make Your First Pull Request (PR) [more](git-pullrequest-workflow.md)

### 5. Engage with the Community

- Join project chats or forums to ask questions.
- Participate in discussions about new ideas and improvements.

#### Useful Tips:
- Don’t be afraid to make mistakes.
- Be patient. It may take time for reviewers to review your Pull Request.
- Learn along the way. Contributing is a great opportunity to gain knowledge.
