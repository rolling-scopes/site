# Visual Testing with Percy and Playwright

## ðŸš¨Reasons for Implementation

In our project, new features are merged into the main branch and deployed to production once approved. However, visual bugsâ€”like missing elements or misaligned imagesâ€”are not always easy to spot manually. To catch these issues early, we implemented automated visual testing using Percy and Playwright.

## ðŸ”¬ How It Works

Percy and Playwright help automate the detection of visual differences in the application by comparing screenshots against established baselines. Hereâ€™s a closer look at the process:

- **Baseline Screenshots:** Percy maintains a set of baseline images that represent the expected appearance of the application. These baselines are used as the standard for comparison in visual tests.
- **Visual Comparison:** When a developer triggers a visual test, Percy takes new screenshots of the modified application and compares them to the existing baseline images. Percyâ€™s advanced algorithms detect even the smallest visual differences, such as pixel shifts, missing elements, or color changes.
- **Handling Discrepancies:** If differences are found, they are highlighted in Percyâ€™s dashboard, where developers can review and approve changes. Discrepancies must be either fixed or approved; if the changes are intentional and correct, the new screenshots can be set as the updated baselines.
- **Updating Baselines:** Once the visual changes are approved, the new screenshots replace the old baselines. This ensures that future comparisons are always against the latest approved version of the application.

## Workflow

1. **Create a PR:** A developer submits a PR with code changes.
2. **Trigger Visual Tests:** The developer comments `run visual now` on the PR.
3. **Run Tests:** The CI/CD pipeline triggers Percy to capture screenshots of the updated application.
4. **Compare Screenshots:** Percy compares the new screenshots with the reference images.
5. **Review Results:** If differences are detected, the test fails, and the results are displayed on the Percy dashboard.

6. **Fix Issues and Re-run:** The developer addresses the identified visual issues and re-runs the visual tests.
7. **Approve Changes:** Once the visual tests pass, the developer approves the changes in the Percy dashboard.
