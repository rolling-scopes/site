# Volunteering at RS.School

RS.School is a volunteer-run project and we welcome everyone who wants to contribute. Whether you're a developer, a tester, or an enthusiast wanting to support our cause, you're welcome in our community.

For developers, this means opportunities to work on real-life projects, hone your skills and contribute by writing code and tests. It's a chance to grow, make connections and give back to the community.

For testers, it’s about more than just finding bugs. It's about understanding the system as a whole and being the vanguard for software quality. You can be an integral part of maintaining high standards on our educational platform.

But irrespective of your role, remember that every contribution counts. Whether it’s writing a line of code, finding a bug, enhancing a document or supporting the community in any other way -- every small effort contributes to the larger goal of making high-quality education accessible for everyone.

At RS.School, we believe in the power of community and collaborative effort. No contribution is too small, every bit helps. You're welcome to join us in this journey of learning, sharing and growing together.
