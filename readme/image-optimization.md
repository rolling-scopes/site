# üé¥ Automated assets optimization

## üí´ Introduction

The problem that we faced is that we experience troubles with initial page loading due to too many images attempting to load all at once, even if those images are not yet visible on the page (especially noticeable on devices, with slow internet connection)

ü´¢ Therefore we are facing a significant performance drop on initial page load, which is unacceptable in modern web:

<img src="assets/bad-performance.png" width="600" alt="image">

To achieve faster loading times, developers use modern `WebP` images and `lazy loading`. This means images only download when they appear on screen.

Our motivation is that developers shouldn't think about trivial performance optimization and focus on more important work.

Therefore we introduced an automated image optimization technique that will produce all the necessary work by itself. The optimizations are performed in a super simple way:

üéâ Developers should use our brand new component API `<Image />`. That will perform all the necessary optimizations automatically.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è The only thing that developer must to watch closely
Is that the images that will be loaded on the start screen - must be loaded with `high priority`, that means that for such images **we need to disable lazy loading**, because it makes no sense to load them lazily ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, and will produce performance drop.

<img src="assets/watch-close.png" width="600" alt="image">

## üöÄ Public API

Familiar API - you can use the component just like basic `img` element, all optimizations are handled behind the scenes for you.
```tsx
// The old way
<img src={photo} alt="Person's photo">
```
```tsx
// The new way (lazy loading is turned on implicitly)
<Image src={photo} alt="Person's photo" />
```

```tsx
// Explicitly disabled lazy loading 
// should be used if an image is on the start screen
<Image src={photo} alt="Person's photo" lazy="false" />
```

The src prop can accept image of any format - `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`... Everything will be converted to `WebP` behind the scenes.

üîÆ In the very end this will produce such result: 

```html
<img loading="eager" srcset="/assets/rs-slope-nodejs-BmvHY6ZF-425.webp 425w, /assets/rs-slope-nodejs-BmvHY6ZF-768.webp 768w, /assets/rs-slope-nodejs-BmvHY6ZF.webp 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 425px, (max-width: 768px) 768px, 1280px" decoding="auto" fetchpriority="high" src="/assets/rs-slope-nodejs-BmvHY6ZF.webp" draggable="false" alt="Node.js">
```

## ü§î How is it working behind the scenes?
1. Any image of any format will be converted to `WebP` and compressed
2. If an image is already in `WebP` format it'll be only compressed
3. `SVG` are compressed as well, using [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo)
4. At the build step the 2 more variants of the image will be generated based on `env` variables breakpoints. By default it's `768px` image for `tablets` and `425px` for `mobile`.

You can also correct the compression value from `1 to 100` - where `1` is the most compressed image and `100` is the most quality respectful.

‚ö†Ô∏è Unfortunately, we need to duplicate the `env` variables in the `build` script and in the `optimizeImages` script. Because the `env` variables are defined for the runtime of each script separately.

```JSON
{
  "build": "tsc && npx cross-env VITE_TABLET=768 VITE_MOBILE=425 vite build && npm run optimizeImages",
  "optimizeImages": "npx cross-env VITE_TABLET=768 VITE_MOBILE=425 VITE_COMPRESS_QUALITY=80 node optimizeImages/optimizeImages.js"
}
```

Also should be mentioned that if an image is very small e.g `90px x 90px` and the `env` variables are greater that this image size, no optimization will be performed for such image - therefore will not be created 2 different smaller sizes.

The `<Image />` component also knows how to deal in such situation, and if there are no responsive image variants for `tablet` and `mobile` - it will fallback to basic `src` image (in our case image of `90px x 90px`)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è To check if responsive images are generated - first build the project and then run ```npm run preview```.

### ‚õî **No optimizations are performed for development mode**
