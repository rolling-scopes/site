# Tests at RS.School Website

At RS.School, we hold a strong emphasis on testing all of our components.
Our aim is to cover our application as much as possible **with unit tests and regression tests**, maintaining an unswerving balance between productivity and quality.

For **developers**, this translates into an integral part of the development process - writing tests.
We believe in 'quality from the start' and hence, unit tests become paramount.
They allow developers to ensure their code behaves as expected and helps in catching errors early in the development process, reducing the overall bug count.

For **testers**, it symbolizes our ongoing search for adding more testing talents to our team.
Being a tester at RS.School is about more than just finding bugs.
It's about understanding the system as a whole and being the vanguard for software
quality.
We are always on the lookout for testers who can contribute to the quality, reliability, and performance of our application.

In short, testing is not just an activity at RS.School.
It's a culture that we have embraced to ensure the best outcomes in product reliability and end-user satisfaction.
