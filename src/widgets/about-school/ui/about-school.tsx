          RS School offers a unique learning experience as a&#160;free, community-based online
          education initiative. The RS&#160;School has been run by the Rolling&#160;Scopes community
          since&#160;2013. Today, over 600&#160;developer-volunteers from various countries and
          companies assist as mentors. We believe in important ideas that guide our mission.
