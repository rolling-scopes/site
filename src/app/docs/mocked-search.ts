Each mentor interviews more people than he planned to mentor (For example, +2 students). After conducting all the interviews, the mentor can expel part of the group in order to keep the number of students he can mentor. At his request, the mentor may postpone the deduction for several weeks in order to make a more informed decision. Checking the level of training of students. Students gaining experience in interviews. Number of students and the order of their invitation: The number of students invited for an interview depends on the number of mentors who enroll in the course. For example, in the previous set (winter, 2019) 158 people enrolled in mentors. We invited TOP810 students for an interview, of which 510 continued their studies in the second stage. Students receive an invitation in the following order: According to the recommendation of the mentor, if the mentor himself is ready to mentor these students. According to the results of training in the first stage of the course. Interview process: Interviews take place during the first two weeks of RS School stage # 2. A list of student-mentor pairs will be available at http://app.rs.school. Students themselves contact the mentor and agree on the date of the interview. Mentor contacts will be available at http://app.rs.school. Interviews can be conducted online. Interview Topics: The basics of OOP. Basic data structures and their organization (array, list, stack, queue, tree, hash table, etc.). Be able to implement a fairly simple algorithm in JavaScript. Basic sorting and search algorithms.

Selector weights. Pseudo-classes. Box model. em vs rem, relative and absolute values. Checking English level during an interview with a mentor: The student can show the test result in English as a basis for setting their level. Student can show certificate of some courses. The mentor may ask additional questions. For training in stage # 2, knowledge of English is not critical. If you are applying for an EPAM job, your English level at the end of stage # 2 should be A2. What should a student do in case of an unsuccessful interview: The student can continue their studies on their own or sign up for the next set. Lectures, assignments and chats are in the public domain. Assignments will not be monitored by a mentor. What to do if a student is not satisfied with an interview with a mentor: In this case, the student needs to describe the situation and his claim to the feedback form - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeN-OYDhazcs7WhZi_oae-u8bCLuVcsksCeZkYcfRMMwj3eJA/viewform.',
